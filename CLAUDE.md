# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide

## Project Overview
RegenHub Boulder member portal and Telegram bot for a cooperative workspace in Boulder, CO.
Self-hosted on local infrastructure (compute-1), not deployed to cloud providers.

## Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces (`apps/web`, `apps/bot`)
- **Web**: Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)
- **Bot**: Node.js + TypeScript Telegram bot (`node-telegram-bot-api`)
- **Database**: Supabase (self-hosted on compute-1)
- **Deployment**: Coolify on compute-1, exposed via Cloudflare Tunnels

## Live URLs
- `https://regenhub.xyz` — production web app (public domain, via Cloudflare Tunnel)
- `https://site.regenhub.build` — same app, internal hostname (also works)
- `https://supabasekong-w8gw0wc80o80c0c8g88kk8og.regenhub.build` — Supabase API

## Development Commands
```bash
pnpm install          # Install all workspace deps
pnpm --filter web dev # Start Next.js dev server
pnpm --filter web build
pnpm --filter bot build
pnpm --filter web lint
```

## Environment Variables
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are baked at **build time** — changing them requires a full redeploy.

Build-time vars live in `apps/web/.env.production` (committed to git — anon key is public by design).
The `.dockerignore` has an exception (`!**/.env.production`) so the file is available during Docker builds.

| Variable | Where | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Web (build-time) | In `.env.production` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Web (build-time) | In `.env.production` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Web (build-time) | In `.env.production` — used for auth redirects |
| `HA_URL` | Web + Bot (runtime) | HA base URL — use direct IP (`http://192.168.1.141:8123/api`). `homeassistant.lan` does not resolve from compute-1; mDNS `homeassistant.local` is unreliable from inside Docker bridge networks. |
| `HA_TOKEN` | Web + Bot (runtime) | Long-lived HA access token |
| `HA_LOCK_ENTITIES` | Web + Bot (runtime) | Comma-separated Z-Wave entity IDs, e.g. `lock.front_door_lock,lock.back_door_lock` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Bot (runtime) | |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Bot (runtime) | Bypasses RLS |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL` | Web (runtime) | Full `postgres://` connection string (supabase_admin role, host-exposed Postgres port on compute-1). **Only** used by the MCP's `list_migrations`/`run_migration`. Unset = those two tools report "not configured" and everything else is unaffected. |
| `MIGRATIONS_DIR` | Web (runtime) | Optional override for where `supabase/migrations/` lives. The Dockerfile copies it into the image and `lib/migrations.ts` finds it from either possible cwd — you shouldn't need this. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot (runtime) | |
| `REGENOS_BASE_URL` | Web (runtime) | regenOS AppView base URL, no trailing slash. Unset = events fall back to the Luma embed and one-login stays off. |
| `REGENOS_COLLECTIVE_DID` | Web (runtime) | The RegenHub collective's `did:plc:…`. Required alongside the base URL for the events swap. |
| `REGENOS_WEB_URL` | Web (runtime) | Public regenOS web origin. **Only** used for the subscribable `calendar.ics` feed URL — event *pages* are in-site (`/events/<did>/<rkey>`) and never depend on this. Unset = no "Subscribe to the calendar" line. |
| `REGENOS_LOGIN_ENABLED` | Web (runtime) | **Default off.** `true`/`1`/`yes` turns on the regenOS login lane + the `/xrpc` proxy. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Web (runtime) | Bearer token required by every `/api/cron/*` route. |
| `NEWSLETTER_UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` | Web (runtime) | Signs newsletter unsubscribe links. Give it its own value — those links sit in inboxes forever and shouldn't share the cron bearer token. Falls back to `CRON_SECRET` if unset (already-mailed links keep verifying); in production, with neither set, signing throws instead of using a default. |

## Database Schema (Supabase)
- `members` — RegenHub members, linked to `auth.users`. `member_type` enum: `cold_desk`, `hot_desk`, `hub_friend`, `day_pass`
- `day_passes` — pool of N-use guest passes per member
- `day_codes` — temporary door codes (PIN slots 125-249) issued against a pass
- `access_logs` — every door access event
- `interests` — public "stay in touch" signups from `/interest`. Linked to `members` via `member_id` (nullable FK). The funnel runs `interests → application → member → auth.users`; whichever events fire first, triggers backfill the linkage so admins can see who came from where.

### Identity linkage
Three identities can exist for one person: an `interests` row (email-only signup), a `members` row (full profile, may pre-exist via Telegram bot or admin add), and an `auth.users` row (created on first magic-link sign-in). They're stitched together by email via two trigger functions plus per-route fallbacks:
- `link_member_on_auth` (migration 004 + extended in 020) fires on `auth.users` insert/update; links `members.supabase_user_id` and `interests.member_id` to whichever rows match the email.
- `link_member_to_auth` (migration 013) fires on `members.email` change; pulls in the auth user if one already exists.
- `/api/interest` (POST) looks up `members` by email at insert time, so the common case (member exists, then signs up to the interest list) is linked synchronously.
- `/portal` (server component) auto-links `members.supabase_user_id` if the auth user signs in with an email matching an unlinked member.

The result: regardless of event order, the linkage materializes the moment all three records can be reconciled.

## Common Tasks

### Trigger a redeploy
Coolify runs on LAN only (`http://192.168.1.200:8000`) — `admin.regenhub.build` DNS is not configured yet. Compute-1's IP was changed from `.228` to `.200` (DHCP reservation, 2026-04).
```bash
# From any LAN machine:
# Web app:
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.200:8000/api/v1/deploy?uuid=ew848c4os44sw0wowwk0ksk8&force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coolify-api-key>"
# Bot (Coolify-managed since 2026-04 — see DEPLOYMENT.md "Telegram Bot"):
curl -X GET "http://192.168.1.200:8000/api/v1/deploy?uuid=t84sosw40088kokwco80kksw&force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coolify-api-key>"
# The MCP server ships INSIDE the web app (regenhub.xyz/mcp) — redeploy web to ship MCP changes.
```

### Check deployment status
```bash
curl "http://192.168.1.200:8000/api/v1/deployments/<dep-uuid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coolify-api-key>" | jq '.status'
```

### Run a DB migration
**Primary path is the MCP** — no SSH, no psql. Merge the new `NNN_name.sql`, redeploy web
(the file has to be *in the image*), then from an MCP client:
`list_migrations()` to see what's pending → `run_migration("NNN_name.sql")` for the
lowest-numbered pending one. Each apply is one transaction and writes a `schema_migrations`
row (migration 043), so there's finally a record of what ran, when, and who ran it.
Fallback (MCP down, or the migration itself broke): psql against the container on compute-1 —
see DEPLOYMENT.md "Run migrations".

### Membership application flow (approve + notify)
`/apply` (sign-in required) → `/api/portal/application` upserts the application, emails the
applicant an acknowledgment, and pings the Telegram group with two buttons:
- **✅ Approve (standard rate)** — bot callback `app_approve_<id>`: flips `approved_for_daily`
  (+`approved_for_full` for desk interest), copies `applications.telegram` →
  `members.telegram_username` (degrades gracefully on handle conflict), emails the applicant
  to self-serve at `/membership`.
- **Custom pricing →** — links to `/admin/applications`; approving there generates a Stripe
  checkout session AND auto-emails the link (`approvalCheckoutEmail`), pings the group, and the
  UI has an "Email link to applicant" resend button (`send-checkout-email` route).

Member-facing lifecycle emails (all in `apps/web/src/lib/email.ts`, sent from the Stripe
webhook): welcome on first activation, payment-reminder on past_due transition, warm exit on
subscription end. The free-day email templates are **duplicated** in `apps/bot/src/email.ts` —
edit both or they drift.

### Add a new member via bot
Use `/admin → Add member` as an admin in the Telegram bot.

### Fix a member's type (if they can't access /mycode)
The bot gates `/mycode` and `/newcode` to permanent members (`cold_desk`, `hot_desk`, `hub_friend`).
If a member reports "Cold/hot desk members only", their `member_type` is `day_pass` and needs changing.
Fix via the admin web panel at `https://regenhub.xyz/admin/members`, or SQL:
```sql
update members set member_type = 'cold_desk' where telegram_username = '@username';
```

### Add HA env vars in Coolify
Both web and bot are Coolify-managed and need `HA_URL`, `HA_TOKEN`, and `HA_LOCK_ENTITIES` at runtime.
Set `HA_LOCK_ENTITIES=lock.front_door_lock,lock.back_door_lock` (comma-separated) to
target multiple Z-Wave locks. Update env via Coolify UI for the relevant app and redeploy.

## regenOS integration (events + one-login)

[regenOS](https://github.com/irlfund/regenOS) is the atproto commons backend. RegenHub uses it for
two independently-switchable things. Both degrade to today's behaviour when unconfigured.

**Events (on whenever `REGENOS_BASE_URL` + `REGENOS_COLLECTIVE_DID` are set).** The landing page's
"Upcoming Events" section renders the collective's public calendar instead of the Luma iframe.

- `lib/regenos/events.ts` — `GET /xrpc/social.scenius.getEvents?scene=<did>&limit=200`, **anonymous**
  (the AppView handler takes no viewer input, so member and non-member callers get byte-identical
  responses and permissioned events are structurally absent). Returns `[]` on any failure, never throws.
  The AppView orders by *indexing* time, not start time — we filter + sort on `startsAt` here.
- `lib/events.ts` — the seam `lib/luma.ts:10-11` promised. One `UpcomingEvent` shape, two sources,
  chosen by config: regenOS first, Luma second.
- `components/landing/UpcomingEvents.tsx` — async server component. **Zero events for any reason
  (quiet calendar, AppView down, timeout) falls back to the Luma embed.** The site never breaks
  because regenOS is down.
- **`/events` + `/events/<did>/<rkey>` — the whole event experience is in-site.** Per Aaron, an
  event link never leaves regenhub.xyz: no lu.ma, no scenius.social. `/events` is the public
  calendar at a 120-day horizon (same Luma fallback contract as the landing section); the detail
  page reads ONE event via anonymous `GET /xrpc/social.scenius.getEvent?uri=at://<did>/community.lexicon.calendar.event/<rkey>`
  and `notFound()`s on anything that isn't a public event (unknown rkey, private event, AppView
  down) — one honest 404, never a leak that a private event exists. No public RSVP; the CTA sends
  people to `/auth/login` + `/portal`. Card/date rendering is shared with the landing section in
  `components/events/EventList.tsx`; a site-relative URL renders as a `next/link`, an absolute one
  (the Luma fallback) keeps the new-tab treatment.
- `lib/regenos/events.ts` `eventUrl()` returns the **site-relative** `/events/<did>/<rkey>` and is
  env-independent. `regenosCalendarIcsUrl()` still points at REGENOS_WEB_URL on purpose — an ICS
  feed is a calendar-app subscription URL, not a page a person navigates to.
- Deliberately NOT changed: the newsletter still reads Luma directly (`lib/newsletter.ts:142`). Its
  copy is Luma-branded end to end; switching it is a product decision, not a plumbing one.

**One-login (`REGENOS_LOGIN_ENABLED`, default OFF).** regenOS becomes the front door; Supabase stays
the session + RLS substrate. Two doors, same finish:

- **Real atproto OAuth** (`lib/regenos/oauth.ts`) — the actual mechanism ("regenOS acting like Google
  OAuth"), matching how regenOS's own frontends (scenius-web, liminal-web) log in. All PAR/PKCE/DPoP/
  token-exchange machinery lives in the AppView (`atrium-oauth`); this app is thin:
  `/oauth-client-metadata.json` (the atproto client-ID metadata doc — its own URL IS the `client_id`,
  confidential `private_key_jwt` once `REGENOS_OAUTH_JWKS_URI` is set, public `none` otherwise),
  `<OAuthSignInButton>` (an identifier form → POST `beginOAuth` via `/xrpc` → 302 to the PDS consent
  screen), and `/oauth/callback` (`<OAuthCallback>` → GET `oauthCallback` via `/xrpc`,
  `credentials:'include'` + `redirect:'manual'`, mirroring regenOS's own `callback.ts`) which lands
  `__Host-rs_session` on this origin then calls the SAME `POST /api/auth/regenos/session` handoff
  below. Needs a matching `OAUTH_CLIENTS` entry on regenOS's side (Lucian's repo/deploy, not this
  one) — `{clientId, redirectUri}` = this app's served metadata doc URL + `/oauth/callback`.
- **Email bridge** (`RegenosLoginPanel.tsx`'s magic-link form) — proves identity by email possession
  instead of real OAuth; kept as a second door, not superseded. Its
  `beginSignup`/`checkEmail`/`chooseHandle` stages are unchanged by the OAuth addition.
- **`/login?token=…`** (`app/login/page.tsx` + `components/auth/MagicLinkWizard.tsx`) — the landing
  page for the link regenOS EMAILS, and the second half of that same wizard. Prod regenOS runs email
  mode, so an address it doesn't know comes back `checkEmail` (not the beta-mode `chooseHandle`
  `RegenosLoginPanel` was written against) and mails `<app_base_url>/login?token=…`; with regenhub.xyz
  as that base the link lands here. The wizard runs `verifySignup` (redeems the token, bound to the
  `__Host-rs_pending` cookie `beginSignup` set on this origin — so a link opened on a *different*
  device can't resume) → handle step (18 chars, `[a-z0-9-]`, **never pre-filled from the email**,
  debounced `checkHandle` probe that never blocks on its own failures) → `setSignupProfile` →
  `createCustodialAccount` (this is what lands `__Host-rs_session`) → the same
  `POST /api/auth/regenos/session` handoff. Wire contract + validation live in
  `lib/regenos/signupWizard.ts` (pure + unit-tested; vitest here is node-env with no jsdom). Flag off
  or no `token` ⇒ redirect to `/auth/login`.

Both doors land the AppView's session cookie on this origin then call the one shared handoff:

- `app/xrpc/[...nsid]/route.ts` — same-origin proxy to the AppView (ported from regenOS's own
  liminal-web). Needed because the AppView's `__Host-rs_session` cookie forbids a `Domain` attribute
  and can only land on the origin that emitted it. **Allowlisted to the login NSIDs (incl.
  `beginOAuth`/`oauthCallback`) plus the three event writes** (`createEvent`/`updateEvent`/
  `deleteEvent`) — nothing else; 404s when the flag is off. Membership-claim sync
  (`setMembership`/`revokeMembership`) is the admin API talking to the AppView
  server-to-server, not this proxy.
- `POST /api/auth/regenos/session` — the handoff, shared by both doors. Reads the regenOS session cookie → `getSession`
  (DID) + `getMyContactPref` (the **verified** login-anchor email, if any) → matches `members` by that
  email, or by `members.did` if there is no email → writes `members.did` → mints a Supabase session via
  `generateLink` + `verifyOtp` (the admin API, no second email). **No member match is not an error**:
  that's a *participant* — a real session with public features only, sent to `/membership`.
  **No verified email is also not an error**: BYOD/passkey accounts mint a participant session against
  a synthetic `@did.regenhub.invalid` address, or a member session if `members.did` already matches.
  Unverified email and handle never claim a member row. Linking a DID onto an existing member (already
  signed in on RegenHub) is `POST /api/auth/regenos/link`, surfaced as a card on `/portal`.
- The verified email is trustworthy because regenOS seeds it server-side from `email_identities` and
  `saveContactPref` refuses any email that isn't the account's login anchor. We require
  `verified === true` and ignore every other channel.
- `members.did` (migration `042`) is **server-written only** and deliberately absent from the profile
  self-edit whitelist (`api/portal/profile/route.ts:63-65`).
- `/portal/events` — **Manage Events**, the stewards' in-portal calendar (no link-out to scenius).
  **Import from Luma** pastes public luma.com / lu.ma URLs/HTML, parses JSON-LD (no Pro API), then
  `createEvent`s the selected rows. `/admin/members` **Sync claims to regenOS** admits paid desk
  and hub friends, plus `day_pass` rows with a live subscription (`active`/`trialing`/`past_due`
  — the $30/$50/$100 ladder). One-off day-pass checkouts (no sub) are revoked. Admins/ops as
  `steward`. Builder grants stay explicit on regenOS — those roles can write events.
  Server component: Supabase session, then `fetchRegenosIdentity` + `fetchRegenosSceneStanding`
  (`getSceneMembers`, whose `steward` flag is computed for the *caller* through the trust resolver;
  we OR it with a direct Builder+ roster row to mirror the AppView's own `owner_or_builder` write
  gate). Not a steward ⇒ an honest explainer, never the form. Mutations are same-origin `/xrpc`
  POSTs from `components/portal/ManageEvents.tsx`; the wire shapes live in `lib/regenos/eventForm.ts`.
  **Events are written with `publicFace: "exact"`** — the default `rough` face gates street/place-name
  into the `event.detail` record we can't read back, so an edit would silently erase the address.
  `updateEvent` re-runs the whole create fan-out, so an edit resends every field it wants to keep.
  After each write the client pings `POST /api/portal/events/revalidate` (`revalidatePath('/')`) so
  the landing page's 5-minute events cache doesn't hide the change.
- The Supabase one-time-link form stays on `/auth/login` as the fallback lane for the whole
  transition — a regenOS outage must never lock a member out of their own door.

**Known gap (upstream, Phase 0):** the AppView's `verify_base_url` / `app_base_url` are global and
single-valued, so in production a magic link started from regenhub.xyz would email a
`scenius.social` URL and set the cookie *there*. Locally you point them at regenhub. Fixing it for
real is the multi-app-origin PR against regenOS.

## MCP Server
The RegenHub MCP is served **in-app** by the web app at `https://regenhub.xyz/mcp` (Streamable
HTTP, native Web Request→Response via the SDK's `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`). It
rides the existing Cloudflare tunnel — no separate app, no LAN/Tailscale, no HMAC bridge. To ship
MCP changes, just redeploy the web app.

- **Connect:** `claude mcp add --transport http regenhub-ops https://regenhub.xyz/mcp` → the CLI
  walks the browser OAuth/consent flow at `/oauth/authorize`.
- **Auth:** standard MCP OAuth 2.1 (Authorization Code + PKCE S256, Dynamic Client Registration,
  refresh). Discovery at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`. The consent page reads the Supabase session directly
  (same origin), so you sign in as your normal RegenHub account.
- **Gating:** entry requires `members.is_ops_admin = true` (migration 041), re-checked **live** on
  every token verification — demoting a member instantly kills their tokens. Tokens are sha-256
  hashed at rest and member-bound (migrations 040/041: `mcp_oauth_clients/codes/tokens`).
- **Code:** OAuth core in `apps/web/src/lib/mcp/oauth.ts`, metadata in `metadata.ts`, tool surface +
  transport in `server.ts`; routes under `apps/web/src/app/{mcp,oauth,.well-known}`. Scopes
  (`read/deploy/locks/migrate`) are wired for the planned per-tier surface (members → day codes,
  admins → events/members, ops → dangerous tools). MCP clients aren't required to *request* a
  scope and ours don't, so `createAuthorizationCode` expands an empty request to the full set,
  and `hasScope()` (metadata.ts) treats an empty scope list as a full grant — entry is already
  `is_ops_admin`-only, so an unscoped token is an ops token, and tokens minted before scopes were
  enforced keep working.
- **Tools:** `ping`; `save_newsletter_draft(issue_key, subject, markdown_body)` (upserts a
  `newsletter_issues` draft via the server-side service client — the whole point: no secrets on the
  caller's machine); `audit_approvals` / `send_checkout_email`; `list_migrations` and
  `run_migration(filename)` (scope `migrate`, see below). To add a tool: register it in `server.ts`
  (zod input shape), redeploy web; the client auto-reconnects and picks up the new tool (bump
  `SERVER_VERSION` to confirm the rollout).
- **Migrations over MCP** (`lib/migrations.ts` + `lib/mcp/migrationTools.ts`): `list_migrations` is
  read-only (applied rows, pending files, checksum drift, whether `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is set);
  `run_migration("NNN_name.sql")` applies exactly the named file in one transaction and writes the
  `schema_migrations` ledger row. Deliberate constraints: the filename is explicit (no "run all"),
  only the **lowest-numbered pending** file may run, applied migrations never re-run, and if the
  ledger table doesn't exist yet the only permitted file is `043_schema_migrations.sql` — the
  bootstrap. Drift (a file edited after it was applied) is reported loudly and never auto-fixed.
  The SQL ships in the Docker image, so **deploy first, then run the migration.**

## Important Notes
- **NEVER restart Supabase via Coolify.** Coolify regenerates ALL `SERVICE_PASSWORD_*` values on restart — but the DB volume retains the old passwords. This breaks every service. If it happens, see the password fix procedure in DEPLOYMENT.md.
- **Kong key rotation:** If Supabase containers are recreated, Coolify may generate JWT keys that don't match the JWT secret (a timing bug). You'll need to generate correctly-signed keys and patch Kong's `kong.yml`. See DEPLOYMENT.md.
- **Traefik + Docker Engine 29.2 bug**: New containers won't get auto-routed. A route-sync daemon and cron watchdog handle this automatically. See DEPLOYMENT.md.
- **Monorepo standalone path**: `server.js` lives at `apps/web/apps/web/server.js` in the container (double-nested by Next.js standalone + pnpm monorepo). Dockerfile handles this correctly.
- **RLS**: All tables have Row Level Security. The service role key (bot) bypasses RLS. The anon key (web) is subject to RLS policies.
- **Build-time env vars**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are in `apps/web/.env.production` (committed). Changing them requires a commit + redeploy.
