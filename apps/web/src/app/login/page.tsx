 * `/login?token=…` — the landing page for the link regenOS EMAILS.
 *
 * This URL isn't ours to choose: prod regenOS (email mode) mails
 * `<app_base_url>/login?token=…` to any address it doesn't know, and with
 * regenhub.xyz as that base the link points here. Until now this app served no
 * `/login`, so every new member's link 404'd — the majority path, since most
 * RegenHub members have no regenOS account yet. `<MagicLinkWizard>` is the
 * second half of the wizard `RegenosLoginPanel` starts.
 *
 * NOT the sign-in page — that stays `/auth/login`. Both redirect cases below
 * land there rather than showing anything: the flag being off means this
 * surface shouldn't exist at all, and a bare `/login` (someone shortening the
 * URL, a bookmark, a link with the query stripped by a mail client) has no
 * token to redeem, so the honest answer to both is "here's the front door".
 * A redirect, not a 404, because `/login` is a name people TYPE.
